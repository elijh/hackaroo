Here is how you make a function:

    function write_hi() {
      write("Well, hello there.");
    }

That is called a function *definition*. We defined a function. If you want to use this function, you *call* it by typing the name and then parentheses. As always, you end your command with a semicolon.

    write_hi();

You can reuse functions over and over.

    write_hi();
    write_hi();
    write_hi();

OK, that is pretty boring. Lets make a function with an *argument*.

A function may require more information in order to perform its action. If we want the computer to paint the door, we should provide a color as well. This additional information is called an *argument*.

The arguments come after the function name and are surrounded by parentheses.

    function write_fish(kind_of_fish) {
      write(kind_of_fish + " fish.");
    }

    write_fish('red');
    write_fish('blue');
    write_fish('one');
    write_fish('two');

Here is a function with two arguments:

    function write_robot(weapon, target) {
      write("the giant robot aims its " + 
        weapon + " at the " + target + "."
      );
    }

    write_robot('laser beam', 'alien ship');
    write_robot('heat ray', 'sea monster');
