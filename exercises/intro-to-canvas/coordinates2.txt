Lets improve upon this by showing the coordinates where the mouse is:

We will use the special function `mouseMoved()`. It is called each time the mouse changes position inside the canvas.

Again, you don't need to copy the comments.

Here is the updated code:

    function setup() {
      g.size(300,300);
      g.background(0);  // this does the same thing 
                        // as g.background(0,0,0);
      g.grid(30);
    }

    function mouseMoved() {
      // reset the background
      g.background(0);
      g.grid(30);
      
      // set white (255) as the draw color
      g.fill(255);
      
      // the variables g.mouseX and g.mouseY hold
      // the current x and y positions of the mouse.
      // Write this position to our canvas:
      
      g.text("x = " + g.mouseX, 10, 20);
      g.text("y = " + g.mouseY, 10, 40);
    }

> NOTE: Make sure that you don't have two `setup()` functions.
