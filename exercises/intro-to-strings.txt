A value like `"hello"` is called a "string" because it is a bunch of individual characters strung together. 

You can break a string on two lines by inserting a "return" in the string with `\n` or a "tab" with `\t`. If you want a literal `\` character, make it double.

    var tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in.";
    var siamese_cat = "I'm a twin\nI'm a twin.";
    var stripy_cat = "I'm a \\striped\\ cat.";

    var multi_cat = "I'll do a list:\n" +
      "\t* Cat food\n" +
      "\t* Fishies\n" + 
      "\t* Catnip";

    write(tabby_cat);
    write(siamese_cat);
    write(stripy_cat);
    write(multi_cat);

Here are more examples:

    var days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun";
    var months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug";

    write("Here are the days: ", days);
    write("Here are the months: ", months);

    write("There's something going on here.\n" +
          "With the plus at the end.\n" +
          "Allows us to span multiple lines.");
