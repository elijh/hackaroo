Hackaroo will help you learn to program, using a series of simple exercises in the Javascript programming language. 

The screen is divided into three main areas: exercises, code, and result.

**Exercise Area**

The exercise area displays instructions for each exercise. There are many exercises, each divided into multiple sections.

* To select an exercise, click *Choose* or &raquo; or &laquo;
* To select a section, click on one of the grey numbered boxes at the top of the exercise area.

The exercise and section numbers start at zero. As you will discover, in programmings, most series start at zero rather than one.

**Code Area**

Every section and exercise has its own area for writing code. 

Anything you type in the code area is automatically saved locally on your computer. 

In order to save your code to the server, hit the *Save* button.

If you want to load the code that is saved on the server, hit the *Load* button. This will overwrite whatever you currently have in the code area, so be careful. 

**Result Area**

As you type in the code area, your program is run and displayed in the result area.

If there are errors, these will be displayed instead of the output of your program.
