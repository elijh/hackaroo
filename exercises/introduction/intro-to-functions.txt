Here is how you make a function:

    function write_hi() {
      write("Well, hello there.");
    }

That is called a function *definition*. We defined a function. If you want to use this function, you *call* it by typing the name and then parentheses. As always, you end your command with a semicolon.

    write_hi();

You can reuse functions over and over:

    write_hi();
    write_hi();
    write_hi();

OK, `write_hi()` was pretty boring. Lets make a function with an *argument*.

A function may require more information in order to perform its action. This additional information is called an *argument*.

The arguments come after the function name and are surrounded by parentheses.

    function write_fish(kind_of_fish) {
      write(kind_of_fish + " fish.");
    }

    write_fish("red");
    write_fish("blue");
    write_fish("one");
    write_fish("two");

Here is a function with two arguments:

    function write_robot(weapon, target) {
      write("the giant robot aims its " + 
        weapon + " at the " + target + "."
      );
    }

    write_robot("laser beam", "alien ship");
    write_robot("heat ray", "sea monster");

Functions can also return a value:

    function the_answer() {
      return 42;
    }

    write("What is the secret to the universe?");
    write(the_answer());

In this example, when we call `the_answer()` this gets replaced by the number 42, which is then passed to `write()`.
