In programming, a *variable* is a bucket with a name you can store values in. For example:

    var cars = 100;
    var space_in_a_car = 4.0;
    var drivers = 30;
    var passengers = 90;

Variables are created by using the keyword `var`. Optionally, you can choose to initialize the value of the variable when you create it. 

You can use variables to compute new variables:

    var cars_not_driven = cars - drivers;
    var cars_driven = drivers;
    var carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car;
    var average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven;

And also use these variables in your output:

    write("There are", cars, "cars available.");
    write("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.");
    write("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.");
    write("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.");
    write("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.");
    write("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.");

You can change the value of your variable any time you want:

    var space_explorers = 5;
    write("There are", space_explorers, "space explorers.");
    write("Then, one is eaten by an alien.");
    space_explorers = space_explorers - 1;
    write("Now there are only", space_explorers);
