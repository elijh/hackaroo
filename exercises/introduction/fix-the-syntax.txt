**Your turn**

One of the most important skills in programming is learning to detect typos. Sometimes, when your program is run, you will get a very confusing error messages. You probably have already. 

So, let's practice detecting errors in the code. If our code violates the form of how javascript is supposed to be written, this is called a "syntax" error. If our code technically follows the language but does something illogical, this is called a "runtime" error. 

Here are two examples:

    // a syntax error
    write("ugh, this doesn't work);

    // a runtime error
    var color = "blue";
    write("My favorite colour is", colour);

Can you spot the errors? For the syntax error, we open the string with `"` but then never finish the string with another `"`. For the runtime error, we called our variable 'color' when we defined it, but then 'colour' when we used it.

Here is a bunch more code with errors in it. Find them all and get the program to run:

    write("to be a good programmer")
    write("you need an eagle eye";
    write(for every detail");
    
    Var speed = 10;
    varposition_x = 10;
    var position_y 10;
    
    write('the spaceship has speed", speed);
    write("and it's x position is" position_x);

Keep searching for errors until you get the code above to run. As you learn to program, finding errors like this becomes second nature.

Here are some errors with functions:

    function duck {
      return "quack";
    }
    
    write("duck goes:");
    write(duck);
    write(duk());

    function chicken() {
      "cluck";
    }
    
    write("chicken goes:")
    write(Chicken());
    write(chicken();
    
    function goose() {
      return "honk";
    
    write("goose goes:");
    write goose();
    write(goose{});

Functions are a litte more tricky. If you have difficulty, check back to the previous section on functions to see how they are defined and used.
