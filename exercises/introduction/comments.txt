Every command you run in your program ends with a semicolon `;`. There are some cases where this is not true, which we will cover later. 

    // A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
    // Anything after the // is ignored by javascript.

    write("I could have code like this."); // and the comment after is ignored

    // You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
    // write("This won't run.");

    write("This will run.");

In the future, when you see comments in the example code, you don't need to copy them.
