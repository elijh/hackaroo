Here is a simple program with comments:

    // Anything after the // is ignored by javascript.
    // This is called a comment.
    
    write("Here is my code"); // and the comment after is ignored

    // You can also use a comment to "disable"
    // or "comment out" a piece of code:
    // write("This won't run.");

    write("This will run.");

In the future, when you see comments in the example code, you don't need to copy them.

Try commenting and uncommenting the different `write()` function calls to see the effect.
