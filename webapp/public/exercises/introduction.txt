Lets get started. Type the code you see below into the area marked 'code' to the right. If the code is typed correctly, the output from running the code is shown under 'result'. 

Here is a very simple program:

    write("Hello World!");
    write("Hello Again");
    write("I like typing this.");
    write("This is fun.");
    write('Yay! Printing.');
    write("I'd much rather you 'not'.");
    write('I "said" do not touch this.');

Note that you can use double `"` or single `'` quotes for writing text values. Single quotes are useful when your text starts with double quotes, and vice versa. 

Every command you run in your program ends with a semicolon `;`. There are some cases where this is not true, which we will cover later. 

    // A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
    // Anything after the // is ignored by javascript.

    write("I could have code like this."); // and the comment after is ignored

    // You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
    // write("This won't run.");

    write("This will run.");

In the future, when you see comments in the example code, you don't need to copy them.

You can print values other than text, too:

    write("I will now count my chickens:");

    write("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4);
    write("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6);

    write("Now I will count the eggs:");
    write(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 1 / 4 + 6);

    write("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?");
    write(3 + 2 < 5 - 7);

    write("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2);
    write("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7);

    write("Oh, that's why it's False.");

    write("How about some more.");

    write("Is it greater?", 5 > -2);
    write("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2);
    write("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2);
